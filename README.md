# Image-Classifier
In this Project, I executed machine learning models that can classify between images of T-shirts and dress-shirts.

The dataset has been derived from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Each example is a flattened 28x28 pixel gray-scale image. 
You can reshape the examples to visualize what each image looks like.

You are given the following files:

• TrainData.csv: It contains 12000 training examples. Each row contains 784 values.                                                                                 
• TrainLabels.csv: This file contains true labels for the examples in TrainExamples.csv(T-shirts = 1 , dress-shirts = -1)
